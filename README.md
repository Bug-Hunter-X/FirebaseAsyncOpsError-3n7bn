# Firebase Realtime Database Asynchronous Operation Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with Firebase's Realtime Database: improper handling of asynchronous operations.  Asynchronous database interactions require careful handling to prevent race conditions and unexpected results. This example showcases the problem and provides a solution using promises and async/await.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file demonstrates incorrect handling of asynchronous operations. Attempting to access data immediately after an asynchronous database read (`once('value')`) might result in errors due to the data not being fully loaded.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle asynchronous Firebase database operations. The solution uses promises and `async/await` to ensure the data is fully loaded before using it.
